# Chrome extensions: CSC193A Web Programming - SECTION 01

[Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/)

These are tricky to learn at first, but are well worth the time
\- [once you learn them](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions),
you can find ideas to automate everything you do on the internet
**Explore more public APIs** and use one (or multiple) in a creative way
similar to CP3.

**Write a web page or application for a holiday gift for family/friends**
More ideas in slides below...

## Side Project Ideas

If you are interested in...

### Biology

- Write a web application that teaches biology concepts through CSS/JS animations
  ([Tabletop Whale](http://tabletopwhale.com/index.html),
  [species-in-pieces](http://www.species-in-pieces.com/#))
- Write a web page with a text area input and processes DNA/RNA/Amino Acid
  sequences (and or converts between each)
- Write an API that sends facts about animals/plants/other biology domains in
  JSON format

## Side Project Ideas (Continued)

### Chemistry

- Write an interactive periodic table
- Write an application that balances chemical equations
- Write an application that calculates molecular weights of different compounds

### Linguistics

- Write a web page that translates English input into some other
  language/variation using your own code or a public API
  ([example (YodaSpeak)](https://market.mashape.com/ismaelc/yoda-speak)
- Write a webpage that randomly generates sentences in that grammar
- Write a web app that replaces common grammar errors in a text area input
  (client-side JS) or file (Node.js)
- Implement [xkcd: Substitutions](https://xkcd.com/1288/)
  and [xkcd: Substitutions 2](https://xkcd.com/1625/)
  and [xkcd: Substitutions 3](https://xkcd.com/1679/)

## **Q**: What are some ways to stay up-to-date with the latest web dev tools and trends?

**Pro-tip: Don't try and learn it all** :)

Follow a couple of blogs/feeds and stay up to day with 1-2 articles a week,
just so that you have a sense of where things are and what recent things have
happened (you can find some lists on the course resources page)

I highly recommend checking out this example
[codeburst.io: The 2018 Web Developer Roadmap](https://codeburst.io/the-2018-web-developer-roadmap-826b1b806e8d)
and seeing what you'd be interested in learning more about
(focus on one thing at a time)

## **Q**: When to consider packages, frameworks, and so on: (example) React, Polymer, Angular, Backbone, Vue, etc

- Be patient, and take it a day at a time
- Focus on one thing and learn it well, and focus early on building a strong
  foundation on web development concepts
- Projects will come, and most of the time there will be many options to choose
  from, usually constrained by your team/codebase requirements
- Most companies have their own framework, and you generally aren't required to
  know it
