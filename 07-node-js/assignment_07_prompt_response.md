# Assignment 7 Ajax Exercise Response

Include three questions you have on AJAX and this process.

1. In the evolution of asynchronous control flow we have callbacks, promises,
   generators/yield, and async/await.. How are async functions and promises
   interoperable?
2. In the iterations of asynchronous control flows why do people still use
   promises instead of just async/await?
3. How does JavaScript (fundamentally single-threaded by design) influence its
    management of concurrency, especially in situations that involve input/output
    operations?
