          <h2>These are my main priorities right now</h2>
          <p>
            I am open to considering new opportunities, while attending Sac
            State and afterwards, for I am always looking to learn and develop a
            better perspective of new things. I aspire to stick to my priorities
            90% of the time, as a result; I will say no to the majority of
            requests that come my way now. If my activities or priorities happen
            to change, I'll update this page to reflect those changes. Inspired
            by

            goals only become meaningful if work is put into its completion.

        <h1>Just Say It</h1>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Don't say that you're "just saying." It refutes the obnoxiousness of
            the Just Saying culture, you know, those people who punctuate their
            shitty opinions with "just saying" because they want to have an
            opinion but avoid criticism for having it. So they drop in there as
            if it is something that they don't have say but somehow feel
            compelled to. What they don't realize is that overusing the word
            "just" undermines their own authority. It's like they are
            apologizing in advance for an opinion no reasonable person could
            hold; for example, "if I were you I would only shoot on film
            cameras, just saying." No! No "just saying!" Defend yourself! Give
            me an opinion, a reason, why you feel that way instead of being a
            jerk who hides behind their own language. You've never read a
            challenging book have you? You define your entire world by the way
            the world reacts to you, but you have no power and that hurts. You
            have no language skills and that hurts, and you don't know how to do
            drive stick.
